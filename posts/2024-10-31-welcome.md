# Automating Tallinn Airport Departures Tracking with GitHub

In this project, I set up a scheduled web scraper to track Tallinn Airport departure data directly within GitHub. Here’s a quick overview of my objectives:

1. **Scheduled Web Scraping with GitHub Actions**: Using GitHub Actions, I created a scheduled, automated web scraper that fetches daily departure data without external servers.

2. **Visualizations with Mermaid**: I incorporated Mermaid to display data in visual form, testing its capabilities as a lightweight visualization tool.

3. **Exploring GitHub for Reporting**: By consolidating scraping, analysis, and visualization into one repository, I assessed GitHub’s potential as a platform for standalone reports.
